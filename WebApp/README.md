# Real Time Web

In this project you can find different ways to get real time (or near real time) updates in the browser.

I demo the following mechanisms:

* Polling
* Long Polling
* Server Sent Events
* Websockets 
* SignalR 

This project creates a web application that host a SignalR hub and a a website with pages that allow testing the different real time updates mechanisms from the browser.
